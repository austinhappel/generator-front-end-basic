# generator-front-end-basic

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) that scaffolds out a very basic, front-end project on a typical website. This generator was meant to be used on projects where you're:

* running a non-node back-end like django, rails, .net, etc.
* not wanting to create a 1-page javascript app
* want to run some tests
* want to ensure a little code consistency
